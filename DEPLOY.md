# Deploying Sitebuilder to production

This is the **complete, copy-paste-able** guide for taking Sitebuilder from
"runs on my laptop" to a public website, on **Linux, macOS, or Windows**.

The app is built to be **driven entirely by environment variables**:
`backend/config/settings.py` uses a friendly dev config by default and flips on
all production hardening automatically when `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`. So most of the
work is *provisioning services and setting env vars* — not writing code.

> **New to deployment? Read this order:** §1 (what you're shipping) → §2
> (prerequisites for your OS) → pick **§4 Docker** (easiest) *or* **§5 manual** →
> §6 (the frontend) → §9 (smoke test). The rest is optional extras.

---

## 1. What you are actually deploying

There are **two separate things** to host. This trips people up, so be clear:

| Piece | What it is | Where it goes | Build command |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Backend API** | Django + DRF (`backend/`) | A Linux server / container (Render, Railway, Fly, a VPS, Docker) | runs `gunicorn` |
| **Frontend** | A static React/Vite bundle (`frontend/`) | Any static host / CDN (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, S3, nginx) | `npm run build` → `frontend/dist/` |

They talk over HTTPS. The frontend is told the API URL at **build time** via
`VITE_API_URL`; the backend allows the frontend's origin via
`DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS`. Get those two to match and you're 90% done.

```
 Browser ──► frontend (static dist/)  ──fetch──►  backend API (gunicorn)
             e.g. https://app.example.com         e.g. https://api.example.com
```

> The backend Docker image does **not** contain the frontend (see
> `backend/Dockerfile`). Ship the frontend bundle separately.

---

## 2. Prerequisites per operating system

You need: **Python 3.12+**, **Node 20+ / npm**, **git**, and (for the easy path)
**Docker**. Production servers are Linux — Windows/macOS are for building and
local testing.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip nodejs npm git
# Docker (optional, recommended): https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```

### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install python@3.12 node git
# Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

### Windows
Install with winget in **PowerShell**, then **reopen the terminal**:
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12 OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS Git.Git
# Docker Desktop (recommended on Windows): winget install Docker.DockerDesktop
```
> **Important (Windows):** `gunicorn` is a Unix-only server and will **not** run
> natively on Windows. For a real Windows-hosted deploy use **Docker Desktop**
> (it runs the Linux container for you — §4) or **WSL2**. You can still *build*
> the frontend and *test in dev mode* natively on Windows.

Check everything is on PATH (all OSes):
```bash
python --version    # Windows: also try  py --version
node --version
npm --version
docker --version    # only if using Docker
```

---

## 3. Generate the things every deploy needs

### 3a. A real `SECRET_KEY`
The app **refuses to boot** in production with the insecure default key, so make
one. Same command on every OS (use `py` instead of `python` on Windows if needed):
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(60))"
```
Copy the output — it goes into `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`.

### 3b. Your domains + DNS
Decide your two hostnames and point their DNS `A`/`CNAME` records at your hosts:
- **Frontend:** e.g. `app.example.com` → your static host / CDN.
- **API:** e.g. `api.example.com` → your backend server / platform.

(You can also serve both from one domain with a reverse proxy; two subdomains is
the simplest mental model.)

### 3c. A database
Get a **managed PostgreSQL** (Render/Railway/Supabase/RDS/etc.) and copy its
connection string. It looks like:
```
postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME
```
That value is `DATABASE_URL`. (The Docker path in §4 spins up its own Postgres,
so you can skip this for a single-server Docker deploy.)

---

## 4. Path A — Docker Compose on one server (recommended first launch)

The repo ships `docker-compose.yml` that runs **Postgres + the Django app under
gunicorn** (migrations run on boot). One command, identical on every OS.

### 4.1 Put your real values in
Open `docker-compose.yml` and edit the `web.environment` block (and the `db`
password). At minimum:
```yaml
  web:
    environment:
      DJANGO_DEBUG: 'False'
      DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: 'PASTE-THE-60-CHAR-KEY-FROM-STEP-3a'
      DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS: 'api.example.com'
      DATABASE_URL: 'postgres://builder:A-STRONG-DB-PASSWORD@db:5432/builder'
      DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS: 'https://app.example.com'
      DJANGO_SSL_REDIRECT: 'True'      # leave False only if nothing terminates TLS yet
      DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA: 'True'       # Django serves uploaded images from the media volume (§8a)
  db:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'A-STRONG-DB-PASSWORD'   # must match DATABASE_URL above
```
> **Hygiene tip:** instead of hardcoding secrets in the YAML, replace the values
> with `${DJANGO_SECRET_KEY}` etc. and create a `.env` file **next to**
> `docker-compose.yml` — Compose auto-loads it for `${VAR}` substitution, and you
> add that `.env` to `.gitignore` so secrets never get committed.

### 4.2 Build and run
From the repo root — **same on Linux, macOS, and Windows (PowerShell or CMD)**:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
- `-d` = run in the background.
- Migrations run automatically on boot; static files were collected at image
  build time.

Watch the logs / check status:
```bash
docker compose logs -f web      # follow the app log (Ctrl-C to stop following)
docker compose ps               # see running containers
```

The API is now on `http://<server>:8000`. Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy
(nginx, Caddy, Traefik, or your cloud load balancer) in front so it's reachable
as `https://api.example.com` — see §8.

### 4.3 Create your admin user
```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Then promote yourself to in-app staff (moderation panel) if you log in with a
normal account — see §7b.

### 4.4 Updating later
```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build     # rebuild + restart; migrations re-run on boot
```

---

## 5. Path B — Manual deploy (gunicorn + managed Postgres)

Use this on a Linux VPS or a PaaS (Render/Railway/Fly) where you run the process
yourself. **All backend commands below assume Linux/macOS** (or WSL/Docker on
Windows — gunicorn is Unix-only, see §2).

### 5.1 Get the code + a virtualenv
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PersonelWebSiteBuilder/backend
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate it:

| OS / shell | Activate command |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS (bash/zsh) | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Windows PowerShell | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Windows CMD | `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` |

Install deps:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5.2 Create `backend/.env`
The backend auto-loads `backend/.env` (via `python-dotenv`), so this is the
cleanest, OS-independent way to set config. Copy the template and edit:
```bash
cp .env.example .env        # Windows PowerShell:  Copy-Item .env.example .env
```
Fill in at least these (uncomment + set):
```ini
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=PASTE-THE-60-CHAR-KEY
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.example.com
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME
DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com
REDIS_URL=redis://HOST:6379/0      # recommended (see §7a)
DJANGO_SSL_REDIRECT=True
DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=True            # unless a proxy or bucket serves /media/ (§8a)
```

### 5.3 Migrate, collect static, create admin
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5.4 Run gunicorn (Linux/macOS)
```bash
gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 3 --timeout 120 --access-logfile -
```
For a real server, run this under a process manager so it restarts on crash/boot
(**systemd** on a VPS, or your PaaS's "start command" field — paste the line
above). Put nginx/Caddy in front for TLS (§8).

> On a **PaaS** (Render/Railway/Fly): set the env vars from §5.2 in the
> dashboard, set the **build command** to
> `pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
> and the **start command** to the gunicorn line above. The platform handles TLS.

---

## 6. The frontend (both paths need this)

The frontend is a **static bundle**. Vite **inlines** `VITE_API_URL` at build
time, so you must set it **before** building and **rebuild** if it changes.

### 6.1 Point it at your API
Create `frontend/.env` (or `.env.production`):
```ini
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com/api
# Optional, only if you use them (same ids as the backend — see §7):
# VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
# VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-site-key
```
> The `/api` suffix matters — the default is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.

### 6.2 Build (same on every OS)
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build        # outputs the static site to frontend/dist/
```

### 6.3 Deploy `frontend/dist/`
- **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages:** point the project at `frontend/`, set
  build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`, and add `VITE_API_URL`
  as an environment variable in their dashboard.
- **S3 / static bucket + CDN:** upload the contents of `dist/`.
- **nginx (self-host):** copy `dist/` to the web root and add an SPA fallback so
  client-side routes work:
  ```nginx
  location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; }
  ```

After it's live, the frontend origin (`https://app.example.com`) **must** be in
the backend's `DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS`, or the browser will block API calls.

### 6.4 Published sites: route `/s/` to the backend

A published site is **served by the backend**, not by the SPA: the editor
renders every page when the site is published and Django returns that document
at `/s/<slug>/` (and `/s/<slug>/<page>/`). That is what a visitor, a search
engine and a link-preview scraper read — the SPA shell carries one fixed title
and no meta tags, and scrapers never run JavaScript.

If the frontend and backend share a domain behind a proxy, send that one path to
the backend **before** the SPA fallback:

```nginx
location /s/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; }
location /   { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; }
```

### Security headers on the SPA page

Django sets `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy` and its CSP on its own responses. The SPA's `index.html` is
served from disk by the proxy, so nothing sets them there unless you do:

```
header {
    Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
    X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy "same-origin"
    X-Frame-Options "DENY"
}
```

Put that in the block that serves the static files, **not** on `/s/` — those
responses carry Django's sandbox CSP and must pass through untouched.

**Do not add a Content-Security-Policy to the SPA page.** The editor previews
the user's page in a `srcdoc` iframe, and a `srcdoc` document inherits the
parent's policy. Measured, not assumed: inline scripts still run under
`'unsafe-inline'`, but a `<script src>` to a CDN is blocked — so a page with a
pasted CDN snippet would look broken in the editor while the published copy
worked. Serving previews from a separate origin is the fix; weakening the
policy until it permits everything is not.

The same applies to `/api/`, `/media/`, `/static/` and whatever you set
`DJANGO_ADMIN_PATH` to — all backend. **`/admin` is not**: that is the app's own
admin panel and Settings page, served by the SPA. Sending `/admin` to Django
puts its login form where the Settings page should be, and a superuser then has
nowhere to set the reCAPTCHA and SMTP keys.

On a split setup (`app.example.com` static + `api.example.com` backend) the
sites answer on the API domain (`https://api.example.com/s/<slug>/`) unless you
add the same rule at your CDN. Either works — the documents carry their own
`<link rel="canonical">`, so pick one and stay with it.

Each response is sandboxed by CSP (`sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms …`, never
`allow-same-origin`): a site's own scripts still run, but with an opaque origin,
so they cannot reach the app's cookies, storage or session. **Do not strip that
header at the proxy.**

## 7. Required + recommended environment variables

### 7a. Reference table (backend)

| Variable | Required? | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | **yes** | `False` | Anything but `False` keeps dev mode on. |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | **yes** | *(60-char string)* | App refuses to boot in prod without it. |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | **yes** | `api.example.com` | Comma-separated. Your **API** host(s). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **yes** | `postgres://…` | Managed Postgres. SQLite if unset (don't, in prod). |
| `DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS` | **yes** | `https://app.example.com` | Your **frontend** origin(s), comma-separated. |
| `REDIS_URL` | recommended | `redis://host:6379/0` | Shares rate-limit counters across gunicorn workers. |
| `DJANGO_SSL_REDIRECT` | recommended | `True` | Default `True` in prod; set `False` only if nothing terminates TLS yet. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | recommended | `https://…@sentry.io/…` | Error monitoring; off when unset. |
| `DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL` | if using email | `https://app.example.com` | Builds the password-reset link. |
| `DJANGO_THROTTLE_GUEST` | no | `30/min` | Per-IP cap on "continue without signing in" and on carrying guest work into an account. Separate from `auth` on purpose: on a shared address those two endpoints must not be closed by other people's failed logins. |
| `DJANGO_ADMIN_PATH` | recommended | `django-admin` | Where Django's own admin lives. Not `admin`: the SPA serves its admin panel and Settings page at `/admin` and `/admin/settings`, and on a single domain the proxy can only give that path to one of them. Pick something only you know. |
| `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA` | **yes, one of** | `True` | Django serves uploaded images from `MEDIA_ROOT`. Defaults to `DJANGO_DEBUG`, so a production process serves **nothing** under `/media/` unless this is on **or** a proxy/bucket does it (§8a) — uploads then succeed but every image URL 404s. |
| `DJANGO_HSTS_SECONDS` | optional | `31536000` | HSTS lifetime (1 year default). |
| `DJANGO_THROTTLE_AUTH` | optional | `10/min` | Brute-force cap on login/register/google. |
| `DJANGO_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` | behind a proxy | `1` | Defaults to `0`: rate limits use the socket peer and ignore `X-Forwarded-For`. Set only for the trusted chain described below. |
| `DJANGO_CSP_REPORT_ONLY` | optional | `True` | Log CSP violations instead of blocking (while testing). |

Behind a TLS-terminating proxy/LB, prod automatically trusts the
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` header (`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`), so make sure your
proxy sets it and cannot be bypassed by a direct public connection to gunicorn.

Rate limits ignore `X-Forwarded-For` by default (`DJANGO_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=0`).
For the single reverse proxy in §8, set `DJANGO_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1` only after
ensuring the proxy overwrites the incoming forwarding header and the backend
port is reachable only by that proxy. With a longer trusted proxy chain, use
its exact hop count and strip client-supplied forwarding headers at the edge.
Leaving `0` behind a proxy groups its visitors under the proxy's shared limit;
trusting a publicly supplied header lets callers evade the limit.

For a host-based proxy in front of Compose, publish the backend on loopback
(`127.0.0.1:8000:8000`) instead of all interfaces, or enforce equivalent firewall
isolation. These settings affect throttle identity; keep `REDIS_URL` configured
so multiple workers share the same counters.

### 7b. Make yourself an admin (moderation panel)
Create a superuser (`createsuperuser`), **or** promote an existing account to
staff so the in-app **Admin** link shows:
```bash
# from backend/, with the venv active (Docker: prefix with `docker compose exec web`)
python manage.py shell -c "from django.contrib.auth.models import User; User.objects.filter(username='YOURNAME').update(is_staff=True, is_superuser=True)"
```

---

## 8. TLS / HTTPS

The app turns on SSL redirect, HSTS, and secure cookies automatically in prod.
You just need something terminating TLS in front of gunicorn:

- **PaaS (Render/Railway/Fly/Netlify/Vercel):** TLS is automatic — nothing to do.
- **Your own VPS:** put **Caddy** (auto-HTTPS, simplest) or **nginx + certbot**
  in front, proxying `https://api.example.com` → `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and
  ensure it forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Minimal Caddy example:
  ```
  api.example.com {
      reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
  }
  ```

If TLS is **not** in place yet on a first bring-up, set `DJANGO_SSL_REDIRECT=False`
temporarily so you're not redirected to a non-existent HTTPS endpoint — then turn
it back on once certs are live.

### 8a. Uploaded images (`/media/`)

Something has to answer `/media/…`, or uploads succeed and their URLs 404.
Pick one:

- **One server (the Compose stack):** `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=True` — Django serves
  the `media` volume (`builder/media.py`). Simple and fine at this scale.
- **A proxy in front:** let it serve the folder and set
  `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=False`. Uploads may be **SVG**, which runs scripts when
  opened directly — send the same sandboxing headers Django sends:
  ```
  api.example.com {
      handle_path /media/* {
          root * /srv/builder/media
          header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src data:; sandbox"
          header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
          file_server
      }
      reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
  }
  ```
- **Several instances:** a local folder is not shared between them — use object
  storage (§11) and set `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=False`.

---

## 8b. Customer domains (`www.their-company.com`)

The platform's own domain (currently `sitebuilt.app`) and a customer's domain
are separate. Do not enter the platform address into a customer's Domain panel.
This feature is optional: leave the routing settings empty until a customer
needs it. Enabling it in code does not change DNS or deploy this configuration.

### Routing and ownership

Set these in the **backend** environment; at least one routing target is needed:

```env
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TARGET=sites.example.net
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_IP=203.0.113.9
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_RESERVED_HOSTS=.sitebuilt.app
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_MEDIA_ORIGIN=https://sitebuilt.app
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DNS_TIMEOUT=2
DJANGO_THROTTLE_DOMAIN_VERIFY=10/min
```

The values above are examples, not a working routing target. `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TARGET`
must resolve to the TLS edge. `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_IP` accepts comma-separated IPv4/IPv6
addresses if both A and AAAA records are offered. The target hostname and every
name below it are reserved, so it never serves customer HTML: the app host itself
works as the target, or use a dedicated routing hostname. Reserve every platform
suffix. Keep Django's session and CSRF cookies host-only. Do not add customer names
or `*` to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: verified database records are their separate
allowlist.

Production (`sitebuilt.app`, set in `docker-compose.override.yml` on the server):

```env
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TARGET=sitebuilt.app
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_IP=144.24.205.170
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_RESERVED_HOSTS=.sitebuilt.app
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_MEDIA_ORIGIN=https://sitebuilt.app
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=sitebuilt.app,www.sitebuilt.app,127.0.0.1
```

The site owner opens **Control centre → Domain**, saves the exact hostname, then
adds the records shown there. A required **TXT** record at `_sitebuilder.<hostname>`
contains a unique value for this site; **CNAME**, or **A/AAAA** records, route traffic.
The panel shows full DNS names so `portfolio.company.com` is not mistaken for `www`.
Some providers append the zone automatically; enter the relative label there.
For an apex, use the displayed A/AAAA option or provider-supported ALIAS/ANAME
flattening. A and CNAME are alternatives; the TXT proof is always required.
Remove stale A/AAAA records that route some visitors elsewhere. Initially keep
proxy/CDN modes off so DNS resolves to the configured edge.

**Check now** verifies both account-bound ownership and routing. Pointing at the
same shared server IP alone is insufficient. Missing/mismatched TXT and bad routing
remain pending; DNS query timeouts have a bounded duration and do not invent a
successful result. Changing or disconnecting a domain invalidates its old proof.
The UI distinguishes DNS verification from HTTPS issuance and reminds owners to
publish before opening a draft on their domain.

### Upgrade existing installations

Install the updated backend requirements (includes `dnspython`) and apply migrations
before starting the new code. The migration adds a verification timestamp and a
unique constraint for nonempty domain names. It stops with an actionable error if
legacy duplicate claims need to be resolved; it never chooses an owner silently.
Old connections verified only by shared IP return to pending and need their new TXT
proof checked again. Republish existing sites to embed the latest navigation/form
runtime; new publishes include it automatically.

### Caddy and HTTPS

A complete, reviewable example is in
[`deploy/Caddyfile.custom-domains.example`](deploy/Caddyfile.custom-domains.example).
Merge it with the current Caddyfile, retaining other sites and the real Django admin
path; it is not automatically applied by `deploy.sh`.

- Set Caddy's `SITEBUILDER_APP_HOST` to the platform hostname, and
  `SITEBUILDER_WEB_ROOT` to the frontend build directory (default `/srv/sitebuilder/dist`).
- Keep the backend reachable only through loopback/private networking. The example
  uses `127.0.0.1:8000`; ensure that address is in `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for the internal
  permission request. Keep the exact trusted proxy count configured.
- The global `on_demand_tls` block calls
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/public/domain-allowed/?domain=<name>`.
  This one endpoint is exempt from the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect because it is called
  inside the TLS handshake. The example blocks it at the public edge. It performs
  no DNS lookup and permits only verified, currently public, unmoderated sites
  owned by active accounts.
- The catch-all HTTPS site preserves the customer's Host and proxies to Django;
  it never serves the SPA. SNI/Host matching is enabled. Customer requests do not
  forward app Authorization or Cookie headers. The platform keeps its existing
  authentication routes on its own host.
- Open ports 80/443; retain Caddy's certificate storage across upgrades. A DNS check
  cannot assert that a certificate exists: Caddy obtains it at the first allowed
  TLS handshake, subject to DNS, network reachability and CA limits.

Validate before reloading:

```bash
SITEBUILDER_APP_HOST=sitebuilt.app caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

For isolated staging tests use the CA staging endpoint documented by Caddy, then
switch to the production issuer for the real customer address. Reference:
[Caddy on-demand TLS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#on-demand-tls),
[Caddy permission endpoint](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#on-demand-tls).

### Acceptance check on a real customer domain

1. Save the hostname, add its TXT and routing records, and run **Check now**.
2. Publish the site. Visit its HTTPS root and an inner page; verify the certificate
   matches that hostname and the page's own navigation, images and forms work.
3. Check `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`. `/api/` and the Django admin must not expose
   platform routes on this hostname. The reserved `/__sitebuilder/form/` endpoint
   accepts submissions only for the site bound to that hostname.
4. Unpublish/disconnect the test site and confirm its custom hostname no longer
   serves it. A takedown or account suspension uses the same public-access gates.

Until a real customer domain has passed these checks, leave TODO runbook step 7
unchecked. A successful HTTPS visit to the platform itself is not this test.

## 9. Post-deploy smoke test (do this before sharing the link)

1. **Frontend loads** at `https://app.example.com` with no console errors.
2. **Register** a new account → you're logged in. (Hammering login should start
   returning HTTP 429 — that's the throttle working.)
3. **Build + publish** a site → open its public URL in an incognito window → it
   renders. Favorite it; the view count ticks once.
4. **HTML upload mode:** import/author a page, add + move a nested element, brush
   a color, Save, Publish.
5. **Admin:** the Admin link shows for your staff account; you can see users,
   sites, and the reports queue.
6. **(If email configured)** run a password reset and confirm the email arrives
   (or, with no SMTP, that the link is printed in the server logs).
7. **DEBUG is really off:** visit a non-existent backend URL — you should get a
   plain 404, **not** Django's yellow debug page.
8. **Images are served:** upload an image in the editor, then open the URL it was
   given (`…/media/images/…`) in a new tab — it must load, not 404 (§8a).

---

## 9b. Housekeeping (one scheduled job)

"Continue without signing in" creates a real user row per visitor who takes it
up, and most of those are a look around and nothing else. One job clears the
ones that are old **and** empty — no site, no image, no favourite. A guest who
made something keeps it: they may still come back and sign up.

```bash
# Docker Compose
docker compose exec backend python manage.py purge_guests --days 30
# Manual deploy (inside the virtualenv)
python manage.py purge_guests --days 30
```

Schedule it daily (cron, systemd timer, or your platform's scheduler). Add
`--dry-run` first if you want to see the count before anything is deleted.

## 10. Optional integrations

All of these are **env-gated** (off until configured) and can *also* be set from
inside the app at **Admin → Settings** (`/admin/settings`) by a superuser — no
env edits, no restart, takes effect immediately. Secrets there are write-only.

- **Redis** (recommended): add a managed Redis (or a `redis` service in Compose)
  and set `REDIS_URL`. Without it, each gunicorn worker counts rate limits
  separately, so the real limit is `workers ×` what you configured.
- **Email / password reset:** set `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`,
  `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, and
  `DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL` (Gmail app password / SendGrid / SES). Port 587 is
  STARTTLS (`EMAIL_USE_TLS=True`); port **465** is implicit SSL and needs
  `EMAIL_USE_SSL=True` with `EMAIL_USE_TLS=False`, or the connection hangs.
  With no `EMAIL_HOST`, reset links are printed to the server log instead —
  handy for testing.
- **Google sign-in:** create an OAuth 2.0 **Web** client at
  <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials>, add your frontend origin
  to *Authorized JavaScript origins*, then put the **same** client id in
  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (backend) **and** `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (frontend,
  rebuild).
- **reCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot"):** get a v2 Checkbox key pair at
  <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>; `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` (backend) +
  `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` (frontend, rebuild).
- **Sentry:** set `SENTRY_DSN` (+ optional `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`).

See `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example` for every variable name.

## 11. Deferred — wire these only when you actually need them

Intentionally **not** built yet (premature before launch); each is small and
well-scoped:

- **Media at horizontal scale (S3):** `MEDIA_ROOT` is a local volume — fine for
  one instance, but uploads from one web node aren't visible to another. At
  multi-instance scale add `django-storages[boto3]`, set the S3 storage backend,
  and provide `AWS_*` env vars. No model changes — `ImageField` URLs just point
  at the bucket, and set `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=False`. (Until then, the Docker
  `media` volume / a single instance with `DJANGO_SERVE_MEDIA=True` is fine.)
- **Token security (JWT):** DRF `TokenAuthentication` issues **static,
  non-expiring** tokens. Throttling + HTTPS cover launch; for stronger security
  move to `djangorestframework-simplejwt` (short access + refresh, rotation).
  Touches login/register responses + the frontend `authStore`, so it's a
  deliberate, tested swap — do it once traffic justifies it.
- **Backups:** managed Postgres providers snapshot automatically — turn it on and
  **test a restore**. Self-hosting? `pg_dump` on a cron + an offsite copy.

## 12. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| App won't start: *"Refusing to boot … insecure default SECRET_KEY"* | Set a real `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` (§3a). |
| `400 Bad Request` / *"DisallowedHost"* | Your API host isn't in `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. |
| Frontend loads but every API call fails (CORS error in console) | Frontend origin missing from `DJANGO_CORS_ORIGINS`, or `VITE_API_URL` is wrong / not rebuilt. |
| Infinite HTTPS redirect loop | TLS not actually terminating in front; set `DJANGO_SSL_REDIRECT=False` until certs are live, or fix the proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto`. |
| CSS/JS 404 on the backend's `/static/` | Run `collectstatic` (Docker does it at build; manual deploys must run it). |
| Rate limit feels too loose under load | Set `REDIS_URL` so workers share counters (§10). |
| Login page has no Google button / captcha | Those are env-gated — set the keys (§10) and rebuild the frontend. |
