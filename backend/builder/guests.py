"""Someone who has not signed up, but is not a stranger either.

The old front door asked for an account before the visitor had seen anything
worth an account: "why would I sign up?" is the honest answer, and most people
left at that. A guest gets a real user row with a made-up name, so everything
downstream — a site's owner, a favourite, a saved draft — works through exactly
the same foreign keys as a full account. The only difference is a flag.

What that flag closes is everything OTHER people would see or that an account
is the point of: publishing, sharing a block to the community, comments and
reports, domains/analytics/form inboxes, and the AI that spends the server's
own API key. Making things for yourself stays open, which is the part that
earns the account later.

Signing up does not start over: upgrade_guest() writes real credentials onto
the same row, so the work made as a guest is still there afterwards.
